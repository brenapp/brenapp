<br />
Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! You can see some of the projects I have worked on here. Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Clemson University, with my target graduation of May 2023! One of my favorite parts of Computer Science is how hands-on it can be, and how easy it is to create something to solve real problems. 

<br />
<br />

Additionally, on weekends, I work with the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation, as an Event Support Specialist to support K-12 robotics competition across the State of South Carolina! It is such an inspiring experience to see all of these hard-working students building the future of STEM.
