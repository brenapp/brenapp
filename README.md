![Hey, I'm Brendan!(https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8839926/159197994-17764cb6-d86b-4ed4-8251-32c1e8e8fd63.png)

<br />
<br />
Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! You can see some of the projects I have worked on here. I graduated from Clemson University in May 2023, and I currently work as a Software Developer for Epic Systems. One of my favorite parts of Computer Science is how hands-on it can be and how easy it is to create something to solve real problems. 

<br />
<br />

In my free time, I also run robotics tournaments for K-12 students, specifically the VEX Robotics Competition and VEX IQ Competition programs. These programs benefitted me massively when I was going through, and nothing else gets me as excited to wake up at 6:00 AM on a Saturday!
