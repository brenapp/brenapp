I graduated from Clemson University in May 2023, and I currently work as a Software Developer for Epic Systems.

<br />

In my free time, I also run robotics tournaments for K-12 students, specifically the VEX Robotics Competition and VEX IQ Competition programs. These programs benefitted me massively when I was going through, and nothing else gets me as excited to wake up at 7:00 AM on a Saturday.
